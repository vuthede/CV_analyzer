Among them, I ran for the head of a sports festival to bring together the 200 leading members of the cultural festival that plays theater. I can understand that studying is important, but I had the desire to make the best memories at this time of my life once and to give momentum to studying throughout the class.

However, I failed team building as a representative of 20 organizations, which led to the situation that the target for customers was not reached. The result was less than 300 people against the goal of at least 500 people. From this extremely regrettable experience I think that it is important to have contact with the organization with love and thought.","If you have experience of appealing other, please fill in freely.","I am enthusiastic, a human being who can spread its fever around.
