T-news (http://www.tnews.jp/), which had the concept of ""getting close to college students' Hataraku"" had two problems. One was that sales were purely sluggish, and the other was that the application was biased in only short-term bytes.
I was particularly concerned about the latter problem and set up a team to solve these two issues with two employees. At that time, not only attracted to Web but also the viewpoint of WEB marketing within the site would be necessary, so we challenged the system strategy from the state of zero knowledge and experience.",④ Attention (400 words),"There were two commitments.

Achievements, roles, concrete efforts of ourselves. (800)","It is that the student's achievement was improved by part-time job of individual guidance cram school. From the experiences supported by many people during the exam, I also wanted to help students beyond a single barrier called the entrance examinations, and began part-time work of individual guidance cram school immediately after entrance to the university. The student who was in charge for the first time was a college student who decided to challenge the second university entrance examination for regret that did not make much effort at the time of taking the exam and future future dreams found. However, there were two problems in passing the aspiring school. The first thing is that I forgot the basic knowledge for blank. Secondly, I earn myself the cost of cram school and university, and it was hard to secure study time for part-time job. I thought that my role is to propose a more efficient way of studying in order to bring students closer to acceptance in this way with lack of skill and time. What I did was (1) to make a rough plan until the center exam and (2) to increase the learning density of the lesson hours. Regarding the plan, we decided to thoroughly conduct the input of knowledge by summer and repeat problem exercises like the actual one after autumn. This is a plan that I thought was optimal, because the top problem is lack of knowledge and because I have experience of taking the exams and knowing the form of the problem and the flow of the exam. Regarding the lessons, we prepared the lessons a number of times in order to convey a lot of knowledge in a short time, prepared several explanation methods according to the student's understanding degree, and then went to class. Also, in order to secure the time of part-time job of the students, we set up the homework to finish within 20 minutes. As a result, the student gradually increased the score, and it was able to get full marks in the center examination production. From this experience, I learned that results will be obtained by choosing the most suitable method according to circumstances. (718)",in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in
