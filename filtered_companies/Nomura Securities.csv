336,in,2017/08/03 8:23:14,Nomura Securities,18 graduates,This selection,Fukushima University,Economy,7.0,Yes,Tentative decision,Aim for Nomura Securities,"I would like to aim at Nomura Securities ""a person who works with good thought and truth"". This word is a human figure that is engraved deeply in my own mind, still in my school's lesson. I could not understand the meaning of this word well as I was a junior high school student. However, I experienced volunteers and part-time jobs, I realized that I can not make something that I do not have to think carefully and, if there is no sincerity there, I will not communicate to people little by little. So I will enter Nomura Securities and want to aim for sincerity professionals that are required not only in Japan but also overseas. And, as a customer's point of view, I would like to contribute to regional revitalization by boosting the flow of ""from savings to investment"" of the Japanese economy with a ""customer first"" attitude.",Recently interested news,"The recent incident I was interested in is that children who accused from Fukushima Prefecture are suffering from bullying in schools and areas. I think that it is difficult for kids to pick out the right information at present in which information is overflowing. I think that education of media literacy is important because now it can easily flow information which is not known true SNS etc. As the net shows big news of people's interests and it is difficult to read important events, I think that it is necessary to know the importance of having questions by not actively reading newspapers or being thrown away by things I will. I think that it will reduce wrong prejudice and misunderstanding by doing so. I think that the importance of asset management will also be understood in Japan by having an interest in the economy from a young age. I also learned about choosing information at high school I was interested in investing, including reading newspapers. Therefore I thought that it would be good if education according to the information society should be carried out not only by educational institutions but also by private enterprises.",in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in

Firstly, the negative impact of the withdrawal of Britain from the EU is fully concerned, but as financial deregulation is proceeding, direct finance is regarded as important and the future of the industry is considered to be bright. Secondly, your company, the largest industry leader, has the opportunity to educate young employees such as the instructor system and to have a good opportunity to be active even by young employees, because it is well-ventilated and it is a company that is worthworking. In the first place, I got a lecture on the securities market theory that you are lecturing in the way that I learned the enjoyment of investment. There, not only in Fukushima Prefecture and Japan, but also on the problems that are occurring in the world, think about why it is occurring and what to do in order to solve it, how from the growth industry derived from it Discuss whether to invest in a company and present it to the whole. Through this internship, we will have experiences that can only be obtained at the actual workplace, and I would like to clarify what I need for me in my future work in your company.","Values ​​valued, motto","The valued values, the motto is to challenge many times without fear of failure and not being satisfied, always having an amenity that is not satisfied without being satisfied with the present situation. I belonged to the water polo club during my high school days. The sports called water sphere has low recognition, but practice was also harsh itself with very hard sports. However, this hard and tough experience gave me the mental power to overcome the university entrance exam for several years. I went to a private university in Tokyo temporarily after two years of ronin 'life. However, at that time, because of my efforts and lack of power, I was unable to enroll in my university of my choice, so I decided to revenge in the transfer exam and a vocational school that I can train the essential English proficiency in the transfer exam I entered. Certainly, I think that giving up is also important, depending on people. However, I can assert that this is my strength. I want to challenge various things greedily, burning the ambition that always aims at always being essential for working at your company.",in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in,in
